                                    When the pandemic took the world by storm, what began as a flexible work arrangement
                                    to
                                    accommodate business needs in times of crisis slowly evolved to include work from
                                    home
                                    (WFH) and remote work options with the occasional in-office attendance. As these
                                    became
                                    the norm, employee expectations of flexible and agile working eventually gave rise
                                    to
                                    the “hybrid work model” that’s shaping the future of work, as we see today.

                                <p>
                                    One hallmark
                                    of the hybrid work model is flexibility—and finding the balance or right blend of
                                    in-office and work from home or remote work for your employees means having the
                                    right
                                    solutions to ensure a seamless transition. But first, let’s clarify the difference
                                    between the key terms: remote work vs working from home and why it matters.

                                    Matters?</h1>

                                <p>Many people would say, “Isn’t it the same?”. ﻿While the terms “working from home”
                                    (WFH)
                                    and “remote work” may be used interchangeably, there are distinct differences
                                    between
                                    the two. </p>

                                <p>
                                    Let’s explore the differences between remote work and WFH, why businesses
                                    should switch from a temporary WFH mindset—and start thinking of WFH and remote work
                                    as
                                    more permanent solutions—and why it matters to your business.

                                <h3 class="mb-4">Why Adopt a Permanent “WFH” or “Remote Work” Mindset?</h3>

                                <p><span class="text-red-2">Research shows</span> that flexibility in terms of work
                                    hours
                                    and location is increasingly
                                    important for businesses to cater to—particularly for the millennial workforce. WFH
                                    or
                                    remote work opportunities promote greater work-life balance, increased productivity,
                                    loyalty, and work satisfaction. </p>

                                <p>According to <span class="text-red-2">research</span>, reasons why WFH or remote work
                                    boosts employees’ productivity include:</p>

                                <ul class="red-square">
                                    <li>Fewer interruptions (68%),</li>
                                    <li>A quiet work environment (68%),</li>
                                    <li>A more comfortable workplace (66%), and</li>
                                    <li>More focused time (63%)</li>
                                </ul>
