                                                workplace, prioritising flexible work practices is a cultural

                                                remote technologies, and they expect employers to do the same and lead

                                                and up to the task? How is their camera? Do they have good sound
                                                quality? Virtual communication won’t always be perfect, but it’s a
                                                business imperative to give your employees the tools they need: 84% of

                                            <p>There’s an age-old battle between what IT decides and what frustrated
                                                users
                                                need. Understandably, your employees may need to work within mandated
                                                software and apps for the key requirements—but don’t let policy be so
                                                stringent that new tools are disregarded. Ask your staff what’s working
                                                for
                                                them. If they’re using something new, be prepared to listen and learn to
                                                understand the gap in capability they are trying to fill. </p>

                                                among employees. Reposition your IT team as a service centre with
                                                customers—your employees. If you’re not sure what technology could

                                                café—ask them. Creating an employee feedback loop that has some tangible
                                                impact will help them feel heard and stay on track.</p>

                                                main concern about hybrid or remote work is the increased cybersecurity
                                                risks in allowing employees to access internet connections across

                                                employees to protect their devices and information. This may mean having
                                                some tough conversations with your IT team—but endpoint security is not
                                                to be taken lightly. Show them that increased security across home

                                                safety1. Whatever business you’re in, health and safety policies and

                                                the workforce—mental health. The two main struggles associated with
                                                remote work are not being able to unplug from work and feelings of
                                                loneliness. Mental health support may look different for each
                                                individual.</p>
                                            <p>For some, it’s having the flexibility to care for children

                                            <p>In hybrid work, it’s inevitable that someone will be remote, despite how
                                                well teams coordinate their in-office days. It can get frustrating for

                                                people to be seen and heard in the meeting room, with the right tools
                                                like in-room microphones, speakers, easy-to-move markerboards, and
                                                displays for various room sizes in the office. This enables you to keep
