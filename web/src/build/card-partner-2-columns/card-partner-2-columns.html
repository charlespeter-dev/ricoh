                                    <p>In the hybrid workplace, how do we ensure all attendees—whether in offices or
                                        remote—can fully participate in meetings? Many room systems are designed
                                        primarily for people in the room, with remote users feeling left on the outside
                                        looking in. Microsoft Teams Rooms are designed to deliver inclusive meeting
                                        experiences with all participants in mind. With a rich ecosystem of connected
                                        meeting devices powered by an intuitive app built for Microsoft Teams, Teams
                                        Rooms turn any meeting spaces into an easy-to-use and inclusive collaboration
                                        space where everyone has a seat at the table, regardless of where they sit.

                                    <p>Ricoh has a strategic global relationship with Microsoft and extensive
