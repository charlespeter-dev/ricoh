                            <p>The pandemic allowed us to reinvent our workplace—and in a hybrid
                                workplace, prioritising flexible work practices is a cultural
                                imperative. To make it work, leadership needs to:</p>

                            <p>Autonomy and trust are essential to motivate a hybrid workforce to
                                maximise productivity. In practice, this can mean a commitment to
                                mobile-friendly applications—more than just your email and calendar—but
                                customising key business apps to be mobile-friendly.</p>

                            <p>Optimising your hybrid workplace requires investments to support virtual
                                collaboration for scheduling and safety. Employees have adapted to
                                remote technologies, and they expect employers to do the same and lead
                                the charge toward user-centric technology. Don’t assume the technician
                                that worked on-site is up to the job for remote work—your people may
                                need different hardware, apps, and technology policies to be successful.
                            </p>
                            <p>Think about their technology needs beyond a phone and a laptop. If
                                employees attend virtual meetings, is their internet connection secure
                                and up to the task? How is their camera? Do they have good sound
                                quality? Virtual communication won’t always be perfect, but it’s a
                                business imperative to give your employees the tools they need: 84% of
                                employees5 are looking for better digital tools.</p>

                        <div class="body">
                            <p>There’s an age-old battle between what IT decides and what frustrated
                                users
                                need. Understandably, your employees may need to work within mandated
                                software and apps for the key requirements—but don’t let policy be so
                                stringent that new tools are disregarded. Ask your staff what’s working
                                for
                                them. If they’re using something new, be prepared to listen and learn to
                                understand the gap in capability they are trying to fill. </p>
                            <p>Forcing your IT
                                department to dictate, use, and enforce outdated policies creates a
                                divide
                                among employees. Reposition your IT team as a service centre with
                                customers—your employees. If you’re not sure what technology could
                                assist
                                your employees as they work from their home office, the kitchen bench,
                                or a
                                café—ask them. Creating an employee feedback loop that has some tangible
                                impact will help them feel heard and stay on track.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="body">
                            <p>As the line blurs between work and life, offering employees a choice of
                                bringing their own communication device or going all-in with company
                                hardware configured to allow for personal use, proves flexibility and
                                trust—but the trick is to do it without compromising data security. The
                                main concern about hybrid or remote work is the increased cybersecurity
                                risks in allowing employees to access internet connections across
                                multiple networks and devices—anytime, anywhere.</p>
                            <p>To address this
                                concern, get your IT team to provide security and software training for
                                employees to protect their devices and information. This may mean having
                                some tough conversations with your IT team—but endpoint security is not
                                to be taken lightly. Show them that increased security across home
                                devices is a positive change.</p>

                        <div class="body">
                            <p>Research shows that employees rank health and safety as a top-five
                                concern—and 86% of employers are already planning on enhancing workplace
                                safety1. Whatever business you’re in, health and safety policies and
                                processes that protect your employees and your clients are
                                non-negotiable. It goes beyond a safe, clean, and healthy
                                workplace—regardless of where your employees work from, their health and
                                safety are still your responsibility.</p>
                            <p>We’ve touched on hygiene and
                                health, but there is a silent issue that has the potential to devastate
                                the workforce—mental health. The two main struggles associated with
                                remote work are not being able to unplug from work and feelings of
                                loneliness. Mental health support may look different for each
                                individual.</p>
                            <p>For some, it’s having the flexibility to care for children
                                or elderly family members; for others it’s about having access to an
                                employee assistance program that offers free, confidential counselling
                                and support. If your business can step up as a support for the whole
                                person rather than monitor them via productivity or absenteeism—you are
                                one step closer to ensuring their wellbeing and their loyalty.</p>

                        <div class="body">
                            <p>In hybrid work, it’s inevitable that someone will be remote, despite how
                                well teams coordinate their in-office days. It can get frustrating for
                                remote colleagues who are unable to participate equally and tend to
                                become less engaged—especially for creative people who often use
                                collaboration tools such as whiteboards and displays. Address how to
                                boost engagement and make your remote employees feel inclusive.</p>
                            <p>One way to bridge the gap is to integrate physical spaces with
                                user-friendly
                                technology, like being able to connect to a meeting on individual
                                devices as well as the technology in the room. For a more seamless and
                                inclusive hybrid collaboration experience, provide solutions that allow
                                people to be seen and heard in the meeting room, with the right tools
                                like in-room microphones, speakers, easy-to-move markerboards, and
                                displays for various room sizes in the office. This enables you to keep
                                the focus on the people and the user experience while technology works
                                seamlessly in the background.
